        <h2>Pacmacro Rules:</h2>

        <div style="background-color: white; width: 800px; font-size: 1.25em; padding: 20px;">
            <p>1. You can go anywhere you want, but you'll get better cell service outdoors.</p>
            <p>2. If you close the app for more than 20s & your client disconnects, you lose! (and everyone else wins)</p>
            <p>3. Pacman is trying to survive for 10 minutes and get as many points as they can, while the ghosts are trying to touch pacman in real life. Unfortunately, pacman is burdened with the large costume while ghosts can move freely.</p>
            <p>4. Luckily for pacman, if they get a powerpellet then they can eat the ghosts, forcing them to wait 1 minute before going back into the game (they are blinded during this time)</p>

            <p>bonus. If a ghost gets within ~1m of pacman, pacman is considered lost, even if they aren't directly touched</p>
